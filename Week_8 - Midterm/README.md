# Week 8 - Midterm Site

## Documentation of My Process

- I more or less followed the layout of my mockups which can be found [here](https://github.com/ml4963/intro-to-web-dev-hw/tree/master/Week_4/img).

### Navbar

### Homepage
- I created the floating image on the side in Illustrator and then animated it with CSS and jQuery.
- I also used [Matt Boldt's](www.mattboldt.com) the typing text effect which I customized using jQuery and added my own custom text as members in a list.

### Projects
- Projects page is divided into two sections: programming and design. In order to separate the two, I created two divs and a javascript script that toggles from one div to the next upon click.
- The programming section is layouted in a grid format. Each cell has a thumbnail of an image of project and label with the name of the project. Upon click, a pop up will appear with a thumbnail project image to the left and a description, which includes the name, links and tags of technology and tools used, to the right.
- The design section, which is incomplete, is also layouted in a grid format and displayed similarily. Instead of a pop up appearing when clicking on each thumbnail image, however, the thumbnail takes the user to a separate page that will display more info about the featured design project.


### Contact
- Contacts page starts off with a greeting and below are social media icons that are wrapped with <a> tags. 
- A form was also made for people to email me. Because github pages can only host static sites, I had to use [Formspree](https://formspree.io/).
