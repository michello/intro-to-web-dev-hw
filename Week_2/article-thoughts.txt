My Thoughts on the Article, "Five Important Considerations for Wireframing"

I liked how insightful the article was in conveying that there are all sorts of things to take into considerations when designing a wireframe. The first step was to clarify the problem (and ask yourselves a couple of important questions: what is the project, what problem is it solving, how do we know its a problem, who is it for, where is this page or tool going to live). It is also enlightening to know that what we should prioritize over other issues and keep in mind of the audience of our work and tailor our wireframes accordingly. In future works, I will work to keep my work clear, concise, and appropriate to the intended audience.
