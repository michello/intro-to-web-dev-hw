## inspo

When I was in middle school, I was sadly mugged at a train station and robbed of my iPod. Inspired by this experience, I decided to replicate my iPod (in the form of an iPod Nano, which I also had, strangely) and have it play the playlist I used to have in middle school. Hope you enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed making this!


## takeaway

- CSS art! It was loads of fun learning how to play around with the shapes to create something even if they were of super basic shapes.
- Javascript >>> jQuery in complexity. With only three all nighters worth of jQuery, I found Javascript to be a pretty fun challenge, since I'm pretty sure jQuery has a module for some functions I had to construct with just pure Javascript.
- Toggling is hard. Though I understand how toggling works, I still have trouble with changing the +/- icon whenever the other is pressed. It doesn't currently work but at least the content is hidden or shown?

## future improv

- Improve CSS art? Earphone line are super simplistic. Would love to improve on this.
- Better way to loop through songs once all are played but people haven't paused. As a temporary solution, I just passed in the function recursively but idk if that's the proper way. It seems like a waste of space but for now it gets the job done.
- More functionality! If I had more time, I'd totally add features such as fast forward & to be able to display lyrics according to whatever song is being played!
- Integrate song API. The songs are saved and stored locally in their own folder but ideally, I would love for the app to just make some API calls to get and play the song.
