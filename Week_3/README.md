# HOMEWORK - Due Thursday, Week 4

## Things in this repo:
* Files & resources used for recipe site
* Link to live version of the recipe site
* Documentation in this README file for recipe site

## Documentation:
Initially, I created this site with a minimalistic theme in mind: picture of food, necessary details (such as difficulty levels, number of servings, time it takes), the ingredients and then the steps.

Because the assignment required that I needed at least a side bar, I decided to create a side bar for the ingredients and highlight that with a background color for emphasis. The steps will naturally go alongside the side bar. 

Thinking of how I was going to format the time the recipe takes, difficulty levels, and number of serving is a little harder to visualize. I didn't want to just list them or write them out in block as these are important elements to highlight. So, I decided to wrap them in block divs and position them side by side and right below the picture for emphasis. 

Overall, the final product isn't quite like how I initilly wanted the recipe site to be. I originally wanted the picture to be positioned to the left of the steps, ingredients, and other necessary info. However, I think the final product highlighted the necessary details far better and I am pleased with how it turned out.
